  description: >
    This blueprint is ideal for all those who want to save money with the PVPC electricity tariff in Spain. It's simple:


    1. Select the PVPC sensor (you have to set it up first in the configuration).

    2. Choose the device you wish to control.
    
    3. Specify how many hours you want it to run.

    4. Specify if you want to run your device during the cheapest or the most expensive periods.

    5. Optionally, specify the number of hours to wait before turning the device on again. Set it to 0 to omit.

    6. Optionally, select some hours that you want to exclude from the optimization.


    This blueprint will automatically turn on the device for the specified number of hours on the cheapest/most expensive tariff, and turn it back off for the rest of the day.

    Note: If the device you want to run cannot be passed to the `homeassistant.turn_on` service, you can create a script and call this script from the blueprint.
