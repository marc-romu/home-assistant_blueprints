    Using this blueprint, you can create a conversation flow between your Telegram Bot and Home Assistant using a conversation agent (like Home Assistant default Assist or OpenAI Conversation).

    ## "Conversation Agent" field

    REQUIRED. Home Assistant conversation agent to respond to your messages.

    ## "Response options" section

    In this section you can set some response options like:

     - **"Reply in private?" field**: If bot is added to a group, set it to TRUE to reply in a private chat to the person who executed the command instead of in the group chat. This is not needed in case you talk directly to the bot in a private chat.

    ## "Filter" section

    Respond to messages coming only from certain users or chats.

    There are two fields: "Filter user_id" and "Filter chat_id". You can add multiple user_ids or chat_ids to each field, but just one per line.

    Keep in mind the Telegram id rules:
    
      - A user id is a number, like in '123456789'.
    
      - A direct chat between a user and the bot (a private chat) has the chat id equal to the user id.

      - A group chat id is a hyphenated number, like in '-123456789'
